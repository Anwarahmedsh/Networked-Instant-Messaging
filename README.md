#Features
•	Multiple Conversations: Users can be involved in multiple conversations simultaneously. The system allows users to manage and switch between different ongoing conversations.

•	Private Conversations: The client program provides a facility for private conversations between two clients. Users can initiate a private conversation and exchange messages exclusively with the selected recipient.

•	Text-Based Communication: The primary mode of communication in the IM system is via typed text messages. Users can enter and send text messages to other participants in the conversation.

•	Network Connectivity: The IM system enables communication between physically remote locations through internet connectivity. Users can connect and communicate with others regardless of their geographical location.

•	No Authentication: Password authentication is not included in the instant messaging system when logging in as a client. Without requiring authentication, users can use any username (up to ten characters) when logging in as clients.

•	Guaranteed delivery: using TCP protocol we guarantee that all sent messages will be delivered successfully to the intended recipient. 

•	Ordered message delivery: using TCP protocol we can maintain the order of messages during transmission. The recipient receives messages in the same order as they were sent, preventing misunderstandings throughout the exchange.
